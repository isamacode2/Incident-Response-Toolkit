# 🚨 Incident Response Toolkit: Your Cybersecurity Excalibur 🚨

Welcome to the Incident Response Toolkit, a meticulously crafted suite of tools designed for digital defenders. With Python's agility at its core, this toolkit offers a robust foundation for Security Operations Centers (SOCs) of all sizes to fortify their cyber defenses.

<br>

## 🌐 At the Core of Guarding 🌐
Amidst the clandestine alleys of the cyber universe, where unseen menaces prowl and networks quietly unveil their tales, the Incident Response Toolkit rises as a steadfast sentinel. It's a creation conceived to bolster SOCs, especially those harnessing scant resources, merging the essence of simplicity with potent efficacy.

<br>

## 🌐 Core Features 🌐

- **Logging Lore**: Chronicle network traffic, server events, and authentication attempts with precision.
- **Analytical Artifacts**: Unravel the hidden narratives within your logs using our suite of analysis tools.
- **Automated Reporting**: Transform raw data into actionable insights with comprehensive reporting features.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up and run the Incident Response Toolkit:

1. **Enter the Toolkit's Directory:** 
   Navigate into the project directory to access the toolkit components.
   ```bash
   cd Incident-Response-Toolkit
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python src/logging/network_logger.py

2. **Run the Scripts:** 
Execute the logging script to start monitoring network traffic. Ensure you have the necessary permissions or run it as a user with sufficient privileges if required.

By following these steps, you'll have the toolkit set up and running on your system. The initial script provided (`network_logger.py`) is just the starting point. Explore the `src/` directory for more scripts related to logging, analysis, and reporting to fully leverage the capabilities of the Incident Response Toolkit.
