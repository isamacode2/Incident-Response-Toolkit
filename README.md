## 📈 Augment Your Arsenal 📈

<br>

The toolkit's current iteration establishes a robust base, offering essential tools for logging and analysis, ready to furnish SOCs with pivotal insights. As the digital domain perpetually expands, defenses must evolve in tandem.

<br>

## 🔍 Quest for Advanced Guard 🚀

<br>

While the present toolkit stands formidable, it's yet to be outfitted with several high-level components:

<br>

- `anomaly_detector.py`: A sophisticated script for flagging unusual activities that may signal potential security incidents.
- `/reporting/`:
  - `incident_summary.py`: Generates concise summaries of detected security incidents.
  - `statistical_report.py`: Offers a deep dive into the statistical analysis of incidents.
  - `action_items_tracker.py`: Provides actionable recommendations based on thorough incident analysis.
