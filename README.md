Expand Your Toolkit 📈

<br>

The current version of the Incident Response Toolkit lays a solid foundation with essential logging and analysis capabilities, designed to empower SOCs with critical insights into their digital environments. However, the digital realm is vast and ever-evolving, and so too must our defenses.

<br>

Missing Pieces of the Arsenal 🔍

<br>

While the toolkit as it stands is robust, there are several advanced components not included in the initial release:

<br>

- `anomaly_detector.py`: A sophisticated script for flagging unusual activities that may signal potential security incidents.
- `/reporting/`:
  - `incident_summary.py`: Generates concise summaries of detected security incidents.
  - `statistical_report.py`: Offers a deep dive into the statistical analysis of incidents.
  - `action_items_tracker.py`: Provides actionable recommendations based on thorough incident analysis.

## Join the Quest for Cyber Resilience 🚀

I recognize the invaluable role these advanced features can play in enhancing your incident response capabilities. If you've explored the toolkit and found its initial offerings align with your needs, you might be ready to unlock its full potential.
